# Directory Structure

> How backend code is organized in this project.

---

## Overview

Backend code for this repo is currently a Python quant package. Keep strategy logic in a
single importable package named `wave_algo`; avoid notebook-only implementations and avoid
spreading first-milestone logic across premature subpackages.

## Module Organization

Use focused modules with stable contracts:

- Put reusable data contracts in `models.py`, not in setup-specific modules.
- Put price/math helpers in `fibonacci.py`; do not duplicate Fibonacci formulas in
  signal calculators.
- Put Elliott Wave invalidation logic in `rules.py`; signal calculators should call
  validators instead of re-implementing hard rules inline.
- Put setup construction in `signals.py`; Wave 3, Wave 5, and Triangle setup functions
  should emit the same diagnostic `TradeSignal` contract.
- Keep `htf.py`, `backtest.py`, and `cli.py` thin until real-data backtesting is in
  scope. Do not hide core rule logic in CLI or backtest code.

---

## Naming Conventions

- Python package name: `wave_algo`.
- Project distribution name: `wave-algo`.
- Setup names should use stable strings such as `wave3`, `wave5`, and
  `triangle_breakout`.
- Directions are `long` and `short`.
- Higher-timeframe states are `bullish`, `bearish`, and `neutral`.

---

## Examples

- `wave_algo/models.py` is the source of truth for pivot, wave, score, target, HTF, and
  signal payload structures.
- `wave_algo/signals.py` is the source of truth for first-milestone setup calculators.
